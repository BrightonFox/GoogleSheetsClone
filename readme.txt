Server Shutdown Instructions:
Option 1. Type in "kill" into the command line and hit enter.
Option 2. Remotley shutdown the server by connecting a client to the server and have the client create a spreadsheet called "DaBaby". Ideally this would be a longer much complex string, but the string was kept short and simple for ease of use.
